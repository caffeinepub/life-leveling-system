# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add AI-powered personalized task generation system with user profiling and progressive difficulty scaling.

**Planned changes:**
- Create user profile setup interface with questionnaire for physical capabilities, health conditions, habits, and preferences
- Implement backend data model for storing user profile information with persistent storage
- Build rule-based task generation algorithm that creates personalized daily tasks based on user profile
- Implement progressive difficulty scaling that tracks completion history and automatically increases challenge
- Create automatic daily quest generation that converts AI tasks into mandatory quests each day
- Add backend task history tracking for completion data and performance metrics
- Integrate AI-generated quests with existing voice control system
- Display profile summary and AI personalization status on dashboard with difficulty progression indicators

**User-visible outcome:** Users complete a profile questionnaire, then receive 3-5 personalized daily quests automatically generated based on their capabilities and preferences. Tasks progressively increase in difficulty as users improve, with voice control support and dashboard tracking of AI personalization status.
